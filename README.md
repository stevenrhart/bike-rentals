# Exploring Bike Rental Data

## Introduction
For this project, I compared data between 2019 and 2020 to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on bike share program revenue for Citi Bike in NYC. Given that the June data was not yet available (at the time of writing), the analysis focuses on the period between January and May for both 2019 and 2020 (12+ million rows of data).

The primary questions answered by the analysis:
  1. What is the effect, if any, of Covid-19 on the total number of bike rentals and average rentals per day?

  2. What is the effect, if any, of Covid-19 on the average bike rental duration?

  3. Are there any significant, observable patterns in the data along the dimensions of Age or Gender?

  4. Are there any perceptible shifts in rider behavior in terms of rides by hour of day or day of the week?

  5. Based on the above analysis and a simplified model for rental pricing, what is the estimated effect on program revenue in 2020?


Enjoy!
